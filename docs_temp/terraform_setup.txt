******** TLS E2E - SSL passthrough **********

Docs: Nice diagram & explanation ingress - LB: https://engineering.sada.com/google-kubernetes-engine-ingress-configuration-for-production-environments-9677a303166a
  Note: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress
  cloud.google.com/neg: '{"ingress": true}'

To try::::

3. What works! Load balancer service type in traefik helm chart, then kubectl get svc in EXTERNAL-IP:

- Creates a network load balancer with full SSL passthrough!


******** TLS termination cluster ************

Managed certificate setup:
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/11354
  Need kubectl or can create via google_compute_managed_ssl_certificate?

Probably can only go up to here though - as need to configure DNS then and wait for active (30 mins)
Be4 creating ingress
After ingress - had to mess around with LB to get HTTPS - HTTP redirection - new FE & change healthcheck on backend
  Could try to automate this but will take some time
