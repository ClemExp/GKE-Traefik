Challenges:
- Load balancer setup and configuration
    Terraform difficulties
    GKE - overwriting configuration automatically if load balancer was created from K8s ingress
    Managed certificates - private key not available - thus forcing use of TLS termination

Slide ideas:
- TLS options pors/cons: https://cordero.me/f5-ssl-options/
- Mindmap scope?!
- DevOps 8 loop with tools utilised? TF base...
    Nice to demostrate effort
