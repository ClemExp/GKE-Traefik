Intro and motivation:
- DevOps, cloud, kubernetes
    - First pipeline security and supply chain
    - Started with securing clusters against threats.. And admission controllers, also ranking against vuln - NIST, MITRE? (kubeadmin / kubebench)
    - Tech delivery - performance overhead on environments

Challenges:
- Load balancer setup and configuration
    Terraform difficulties
    GKE - overwriting configuration automatically if load balancer was created from K8s ingress
    Managed certificates - private key not available - thus forcing use of TLS termination

Slide ideas:
- TLS options pors/cons: https://cordero.me/f5-ssl-options/
- Mindmap scope?!
- DevOps 8 loop with tools utilised? TF base...
    Nice to demostrate effort
