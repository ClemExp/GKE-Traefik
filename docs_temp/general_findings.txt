Key findings:
- TLS handshake & different cipher suites times
- Cloudfare, google.. others? Only support 3 TLS cipher suites with their certificates
- With Google, AWS managed certificates - you cannot perform full TLS - as no private key available to encrypt secrets in K8s
    - Have to bring your own certificate
- OQS in K8s not possible yet I think via TLS passthrough.. would need some form of TLS bridging from traefik - pod
    - Which would in effect not be a good comparison of performance of TLS E2E - Limit OQS comparision testing

Updates:
- Updates
    - Have E2E TLS working - using lets encrypt - seperate cluster
    - Developed 2 terraform repos for managing costs with different clusters
    - Developed simple docker for (HTTPS POSTs) - larger requests to measure crypto
    - Selected testing & monitoring tools and did some initial testing on these (seperate TLS handshake, record cipher used)
- Main areas now for next days:
    - OQS - reverse proxy from ingress controller
    - Concentrate on TLS tests and results comparisons
    - Start writing!
- Limitations
    - OQS - can do some testing via K8s - but as its TLS bridging results may not be some comparative
- Updated mindmap (attached)
