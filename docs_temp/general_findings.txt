Key findings:
- TLS handshake & different cipher suites times
- Cloudfare, google.. others? Only support 3 TLS cipher suites with their certificates
- With Google, AWS managed certificates - you cannot perform full TLS - as no private key available to encrypt secrets in K8s
    - Have to bring your own certificate
- OQS in K8s not possible yet I think via TLS passthrough (as these certificates are not recognized by authorities).. 
    would need some form of TLS bridging from traefik - pod
    - Which would in effect not be a good comparison of performance of TLS E2E - Limit OQS comparision testing

Next update:
- Updates
    - Have to be a first draft!
    - Some findings about tests
    - OQS TLS bridging?
- Main areas now for next days:
    - Expand on first draft
- Limitations
    - ...
- Updated mindmap (attached)
