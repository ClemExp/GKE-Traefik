Key findings:
- TLS handshake & different cipher suites times
- Cloudfare, google.. others? Only support 3 TLS cipher suites with their certificates
- With Google, AWS managed certificates - you cannot perform full TLS - as no private key available to encrypt secrets in K8s
    - Have to bring your own certificate
- OQS in K8s not possible yet I think via TLS passthrough.. would need some form of TLS bridging from traefik - pod
    - Which would in effect not be a good comparison of performance of TLS E2E - Limit OQS comparision testing

Updates:
- Updates
    - Installing & configuring monitoring
    - Working on some initial TLS testing
    - Worked out how to alter cipher suites to cluster applications
    - Started documentation of github, & some brief docs on background, cloud setup etc - but haven't added to overleaf yet
- 2 main areas now for next days:
    - Quite critical to get E2E TLS working - focus in on this
    - Want to do some simple docker development to measure crypto (HTTPS POSTs)
- Limitations
    TLS ciphers (TLS1.2 & 1.3) - supported by certificates 
    Quantum issue in cluster - may limit to handshake only
- Haven't started documenting TFM yet, but will start on this by mid August
- Updated mindmap (attach)

Next update:
- K6 testing tool to investigate dynamic loads
- Finalalize monitoring
