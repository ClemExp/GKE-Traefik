Workaround:
- Expose traefik with LE cert via NodePort - worked at least in tls offloading cluster
    . Would need to check if prom can monitor this
    - Then could monitor traffic from E2E via K6 & traefik - app (HTTPS & HTTP)

With TF E2E.. what next to try:
- Create FE & BE configs first
    - Then associate with traefik service & ingress 
        (I don't think service here is ingress to create LB, could be new service or traefik helm service annotations)
            Need to check traefik helm service if exists (prior to LB ingress) & add annotations
